In the last blog, we concluded it with the statement:

-> measurement collapses wave function of a quantum particle

Now we will focus more on this. 

We talked about how the presence of the entity in wave form is spatial like a wave. 
And how its wave function has the data of probabilities of how ( where ) the wave collapses into particle mode. 

This can be seen from a different perspective now. 
here is a different viewpoint:

The entity in wave form during transmission, maybe consist of few crests and troughs (the highs and lows of the waves) 
now there are many points that can be pointed in that curvy line if we can see it that way.

many points in that curvy line where the function could collapse into particle mode. 

I would say that the entity is present "everywhere" throughout the "wave" 
why am I saying everywhere? the nerds would argue that its not everywhere but you just don't know where until measured but
bro, doesn't it mean that its everywhere ?

It has a probability ( often different (as per wave function) ) to be found ( measured / collapsed into ) 
on each of the points on the curvy line. 

This property to be able to be found anywhere 
or what I would say to be everywhere - is called superposition. 

The entity is in superposition of all the points in that curvy line where it has a probability to be collapsed into. 

We conclude the blog with one statement ( which needs further refining which will happen in future blogs )

-> superposition of a quantum particle refers to the
   ability of the particle to be able to be measured/collapsed differently ( different points in the curvy line) 
   based on the probabilities that can be calculated from the particle's wavefunction
